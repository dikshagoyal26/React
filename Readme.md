react design principles

> export default Title-> export Title by default
default import -> import Title from "./Title" 
> export const Title -> export by title
named import -> import {Title} from "./Title"
>import * as Obj from ""

> named import at 12:14
> named export

> react has one way data binding - 

> every component in react maintains a state
> you can put all variable in state
> local variables are put into state

> state -> useState() hook

> what is state? why?
- local varibles
- 

> what is hook? why?
- just a normal function


> what is useUstate()? why?
- to create local state variables
- returns array, [variabble & a fn to update]



> never call a component inside another component

> hooks
> never write useState inside if else/ for loop
> never use useState outside a functional component
