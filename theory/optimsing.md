● When and why do we need lazy()?
<!-- TODO -->


● What is suspense?
<!-- TODO -->



● Why we got this error : A component suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator. To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with startTransition? How does suspense fix this error?

● Advantages and disadvantages of using this code splitting pattern?

● When do we and why do we need suspense?

● Why do we need custom hooks?
> modularity - more testable. broken down into meaningful pieces
> reusability - re-use it
> readability - abstract logic, makes more readable
> maintainable - easy to debug


> hook is just a fn



> Chunking
> Code Splitting
> Dynamic Bunding
> Lazy Loading
> On demand loading
> Dynamic Imports



> images over cdn
> compress images

> cache it


> when you are loading a component on demand, react suspends it

> upon on demand loading -> upon render -> suspends loading


> never dynamically load component inside another component
