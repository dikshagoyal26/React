<!-- TODO -->


● What would happen if we do `console.log(useState())`?
> It will return an array with the first value as undefined & second value as a function

● How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array?
> useEffect will be executed after every render

● What is SPA?
> SPA or single Page Application is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.


● Difference between Client Side Routing & Server Side Routing?
> CLient side routing - Client side routing allows the app to update the URL from a link click without making another request for another document from the server. Instead, an app can immediately render some new UI and make data requests with fetch to update the page with new information.
> Server side roting - all pages are requested from server. It means every page is returned by server & then the page is rendered



<!-- TODO : add a login page using Formik library -->
